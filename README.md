In many cases, __learning something new__ is essentially a question of what youtube video to watch first. __Youtube__ is, however, not a platform particlary well suited for the kind of attention and focusing that learning requires; it feeds on __short attention span__ and __non-productive__ behavioural patterns. 

__This app__ is supposed to be a small step in the right direction. For me and hopefully for you too. 

## Basic Features
* Search for a video 
* Watch _the video_ (nothing else!)
* Minimalistic and _Optional_ GUI  

## More Info 
This app is build [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), as my first project with this technology. Therefore, it will probably not be perfect at first attempt. If you want to make it better, just create a pull request, critisize, comment, contribute to conversations and everything else. All help and feedback is both welcomed and encouraged 🐶
